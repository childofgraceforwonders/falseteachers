    <h1>Faith That Moves Mountains</h1>
    <p>Understanding Jesus' Teaching in Mark 11:22–24</p>

      <h2>What Did Jesus Really Mean?</h2>
      <p>In <strong>Mark 11:23</strong>, Jesus says:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jesus had just cursed a fig tree, which then withered. This was more than a miracle — it was a prophetic act symbolizing judgment on unfruitful Israel. When the disciples marvel at this, Jesus uses the moment to teach about <strong>faith-filled prayer</strong>, not about declaration-based control.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        The focus is on trusting God’s power, not manipulating outcomes through spoken words.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Role of God's Will</h2>
      <p>Compare with <strong>1 John 5:14</strong>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything <strong>according to His will</strong>, He hears us.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jesus is not giving us a blank check. True faith submits to God's sovereign will and seeks His timing. Even Jesus prayed in Gethsemane: “Not My will, but Yours be done.”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Jesus Was <em>Not</em> Teaching</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>He was not teaching us to manifest whatever we want by speaking it.</li>
        <li>He was not replacing prayer with declarations.</li>
        <li>He was not promoting a formula or ritual for guaranteed results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The modern “decree and declare” movement often misuses this passage by detaching it from prayer and submission to God's will.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reconciling the Text — No Contradiction</h2>
      <p>Jesus' words about speaking in faith do not contradict biblical warnings against presumption or false authority. His emphasis is that with sincere, believing prayer — rooted in God’s will — impossible things become possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>A Helpful Analogy</h2>
      <p>Picture a child who trusts their father. The child asks boldly, not because they have power, but because they trust their father’s love. They don’t command — they request. The father may say yes, no, or wait — but always in love.</p>

            <td>“Thy will be done”</td>

      <h2>Conclusion: Keep Jesus at the Center</h2>
      <p>We must not reduce faith to formulas or turn prayer into performance. Trust in the character of God, pray boldly yet humbly, and remember:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “Not my will, but Yours be done.” — Luke 22:42
